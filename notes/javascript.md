# JavaScript

## HOW IT WORKS 

Javascript works along with HTML and CSS to male web pages interactive. 

I am learning JavaScript using the help of both SmolJames on youTube and the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta)" class. 

So far, it reminds me a lot of Python. 

## Here is my first loop to print out 7 numbers. 
On my way to making a pyramid apparently. freecodecamp course seems nice so far. 

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
console.log(i)
}
